# Tristan's Portfolio

This portfolio website showcases my journey and skills as a Software Engineer. It is a fully responsive, modern, and visually engaging site built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with an emphasis on providing a seamless experience across all devices.

## Key Features:

### 1. Responsive Design with Media Queries
The site is built mobile-first and adapts to different screen sizes using **CSS media queries**. On smaller screens, a **hamburger menu** is displayed for easy navigation, which transitions into a traditional navigation bar on larger screens. The layout, font sizes, and image scaling are all optimized for various screen resolutions to ensure a smooth user experience.

- On screens smaller than **768px**, the site uses a compact layout with the hamburger menu.
- On screens larger than **768px**, the full navigation bar is shown, and elements like images and text are resized for better readability.

### 2. Profile Hero Section
The hero section contains my profile picture, a message, and a call-to-action button to explore my projects. Media queries ensure that the profile picture and text scale appropriately on larger screens, providing a well-proportioned and centered layout.

### 3. Skills Section
The skills section highlights my proficiency in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**. Animated skill bars, driven by **JavaScript**, represent each skill's level. The layout and size of the skills bars adjust with media queries to maintain readability and balance on larger screens.

### 4. Projects and Contact Information
My projects are presented with engaging project cards that scale dynamically using media queries. Links to **GitHub** and **LinkedIn** are easily accessible via social media icons in the footer, which also adapts based on screen size.

### 5. Deployment
This portfolio is deployed via **GitHub Pages**, ensuring it's easily accessible and secure via HTTPS.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5** for semantic structure.
- **CSS3** with **media queries** to ensure the design is fully responsive, catering to both mobile and desktop users.
- **JavaScript** to add interactive elements like the animated skill bars.
- **GitHub Pages** for live hosting.
